# Environment variables for LogicLingua React App

# ----- DEVELOPMENT -----
# For local development, the React development server will typically run on a different port
# (e.g., 3000) than the backend API server.
# Set this to the base URL of your local backend API.
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000

# ----- PRODUCTION -----
# For production builds, replace this with the actual base URL of your deployed backend API.
# Example: REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://api.logiclingua.com
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - These variables are embedded during the build process.
# - You need to restart the development server if you change .env files.
# - For Create React App, environment variables MUST start with REACT_APP_ to be embedded.

# Other potential environment variables can be added here if needed in the future.
# For example, if you integrate a third-party service with a public key:
# REACT_APP_THIRD_PARTY_SERVICE_KEY=your_public_key_here
